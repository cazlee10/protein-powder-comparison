      <h2>FAQ: Protein Powder & Weight Loss</h2>
      <p><strong>Can protein powder help me lose belly fat?</strong><br />
      Yes—protein reduces overall fat by boosting metabolism and satiety, but spot-reducing belly fat isn't possible.</p>

      <p><strong>How many protein shakes per day for weight loss?</strong><br />
      1–2 shakes daily are typically safe. Whole foods should still be the base of your diet.</p>

      <p><strong>Is protein powder good for women trying to lose weight?</strong><br />
      Absolutely. Protein supports fat loss, lean muscle, and appetite control in both men and women.</p>
